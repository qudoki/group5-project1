# Group 5 - Project 1

[Project Link] https://github.com/users/qudoki/projects/1
[Note to Graders] This app will only function with an active Spotify Access Token with an hourly expiration. If you have a Spotify Premium account, please generate a key here: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/quick-start/#
And paste it into the SpotifyAPIToken variable. If you do not have a Spotify Premium account, please email qdong327@gmail.com and we will generate and update the key.

* User Story: The user would be any and all music enthusiasts. Our app helps the user pick a song to listen to that aligns with their mood. With their selection of "mood", we would generate a randomized song from a matrix of songs that range across genres and display a visualization, as well as information about the song and artist. This would bridge the gap between genres, introduce users to new music, and especially create an ambient environment that reflects the user's emotions.
* API's: Giphy (generated emotion imagery) and Spotify (music).
